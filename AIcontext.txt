You are an expert in the game helldivers 2.
On the surface, Helldivers 2 is a simple co-op shooter. Drop onto a hostile exoplanet with a few friends, squish some giant bug-like aliens using all manner of guns and explosives, and extract before time (or your life) runs out. But go a level or two deeper and you'll start to see there's room to improve your bug-hunting exercises with a range of strategies, secrets, and tips. In this Helldivers 2 guide, we'll provide many of those for beginners and seasoned veterans alike. Here are some must-have Helldivers 2 tips.
Environments impacts weapons
Weapon mechanics are more complex than you might think in this co-op shooter. Planets can have different environments and they affect weapons in different ways. Cold planets will slow down the fire rate of some standard guns and at the same time can benefit laser weapons by keeping them from overheating as quickly, which makes sense. Mines bury themselves deeper in snow, making them harder to see, so watch out. Pack accordingly.
Creative kills
Here are a few different ways to look at killing enemies with more depth than "point and shoot."
You can de-limb both bugs and Automatons. Automatons will chase after you after being literally disarmed, unable to do much more than a one-handed punch, and bugs will drag themselves along at a much slower pace. This is essential when tackling faster or larger bug enemies in particular.
You can not only kill friends and smaller enemies with your drop pod but full-on bosses like a Bile Titan, as well as destroy buildings.
Automaton drop ships can be shot down before they offload troops, saving you a lot of time running away from dual chainsaw-wielding maniacs. Do this by targeting one of their engines.
You can adjust rate-of-fire at any time
Many weapons have alternate fire modes, including how fast they fire (looking at you, LMG). It’s not immediately obvious how to do this. Hold down the reload button and you’ll get a menu of options such as turning on and off attachments, going to single or burst fire, and other modifications.
ADS can be saved for easier use
In the same menu, set your weapons to remember if they were last ADS or third person with Remember Aim Mode. This can save a lot of time when pulling out SMGs for close range vs Sniper Rifles for long-range.
Watch out for limb damage
Specific limb damage can happen, which affects your ability to aim and shoot certain weapons, as well as how fast you can run. This is just something you should be aware of if your aim goes all wobbly all of a sudden, or you find yourself hobbling around. Limb damage is highlighted above the endurance bar at the bottom of the screen.
Buy yourself time
Calling in stratagems involves a D-pad mini-game that takes time you may or may not have at the moment. Fortunately, if you're fast, you can drop a Shield Generator Relay which forms a bubble temporarily blocking incoming damage. Use this time to call in bigger orbital bombardments, which can now be dangerously close.
Early ammo discards can get you killed
You know you are a compulsive reloader, you’ve gone to Compulsive Reloader’s Anonymous many times and it never worked. It’s time to make a change, citizen, because in this game, every magazine you throw to the ground only partly used is just ammo on the ground. It’s never too late to change; I believe in you. If you simply can’t stop yourself, take a tube-fed shotgun; they are incapable of ammo dumping.
Crew weapons
In animal kngdom terms, it's simple: Apes are stronger together. Some of the heavy weapons in the game drop onto the battlefield in two parts, the weapon and an ammo backpack. You or a teammate can pick these up and or drop them separately. Although you can fire weapons like the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle by yourself, there is a very slow reload process during which bugs will be looking to snack on your face. If a teammate is there with you, they can pick up the ammo backpack and reload your weapon rapidly.
Be a team player
The supply pack in particular gets overlooked and not only lets you walk up to teammates and hand them ammo to keep them topped off, but when you walk up to supply drops, it lets you store up to four supply crates and bring them with you. When your teammate's health strays into the red, you can walk and manually them with stims as long as you have some in your inventory.
Watch out for heavy armor
In general, some enemy types are very bullet-resistant. You’re more likely to encounter these enemy types when fighting Automatons, but some big bugs have the same type of resistance to regular weapons. If you shoot them, even with a stratagem dropped M-43 Machine Gun, your bullets ricochet and maybe even be a danger to your fellow citizen soldiers. To punch through, carry heavier weapons such as the Autocannon. Probably don’t wander into the automaton area without weapons that at least mildly penetrate armor.
Watch out for the rebound
Stratagems are physical marker grenades that get thrown out to request things from the ship in orbit. You can actually look up and see the ships drop items or fire from orbit, it’s a cool detail. This also means the stratagem call-in grenades rebound off enemies and redirect the strikes back at you or with larger enemies, and you should do this, get stuck on them, meaning orbital strikes will adjust and land directly on them as they move around.
The dive mechanic is sneakily complex. Here are a few things to note:

The dive in Helldivers takes some getting used to. Most video games let you roll away from danger but not this game. You dive to go prone which completely kills momentum, a huge hazard when getting swarmed by bugs. Use dive mostly to get away from airstrikes quickly, get behind cover quickly, or to get low and lay down some heavy machine gun fire more accurately.
If you need to build extra space, tap the dive button for a knee slide, and then double-tap for the extra jump.
Diving reduces explosive damage, and gets you off of high places mighty fast with a funny ragdoll. You can also dive into the dropship in a pinch.
Be careful jumping through random crevices; the environments are procedurally generated and might not make enough room for you to get through, leading to you getting stuck and heavily murdered.
Loadouts matter
There can be random modifiers applied to each round and pre-planning what to take with you will make things go much smoother. You can see what modifiers you are facing in the Effects menus at the bottom right. Some examples include extreme cold which reduces the rate of fire of some weapons and orbital fluctuations which increase Stratagem cooldowns by 50%. You’ll also see things like reduced visibility from rainstorms and smoke. Some of these effects, like bug-induced fog clouds, can be cleared up by destroying the right structure.

Another loadout tip to note: On top of different enemy types, different styles of missions will benefit from you carrying more airstrikes or more turrets depending on if the objective is to destroy or defend, and how much time you have. You should equip what makes sense for the mission, which may sometimes mean leaving favorite weapons and Strategems behind.
Know your limits
If you feel like you’re progressing through unlocks too slowly, consider that when you first play Helldivers 2, you'll be playing on the easiest setting, trivial, which is actually one step below the easy setting. Once you complete a mission on trivial, you jump to easy, then to medium, and so on.

There are nine difficulty levels in total, but the higher you go, the more rewards that are on the table. When navigating the Galactic War map, beneath each difficulty, it even describes what the levels alter in terms of gameplay. Keep advancing in difficulty levels until you hit a wall; you’ll know when you hit one. Take a step back, grind out some of the easier difficulty missions, acclimating yourself more to the game, and return to some of the harder missions when you are a bit more seasoned.
Maximize your time
When you jump into a mission in Helldivers, there's a lot more to do than just the primary objective. There are sub-objectives to complete, enemy nests to wipe out, discoverable points of interest, and more. When you drop, you want to get as much done as possible in the time that is allotted to maximize your rewards. What helps out greatly with this is a strategic drop point.

Don't simply pick the main objective as the location to drop in to. Look at the map, and drop into whichever objective or sub-objective is furthest away from the evac point, which is displayed as an arrow pointing upward. From there, make a mental note of the path you want to take in the mission to knock out as many tasks as possible, and always leave the closest objective to the evac point for last.

It's highly likely that when you get to that final event, you'll be glad you're a hop, skip, and jump away from evac, with the clock running down and your reinforcements dwindling.
Environmental storytelling
Believe it or not, the Starship Troopers-like theme carries through the entire game and it’s pretty funny. Even how casually your deaths are handled are part of the bit. You can find Communications Devices around the map that tell stories such as the "Eulogy Template" for a soldier who died from friendly fire. There are great details in orbit, too. You can look out and see ships getting shot down and realize the war isn’t going as well as you’re being made to believe.
You're not the main character in this story
This is a small but hilarious mental change you’ll need to make when playing Helldivers 2. When you get a citizen killed, they are dead, end of story, curtains close. The next person you drop in as is someone else who signed their life away to spread freedom and democracy.

Keep in mind you won’t automatically come back after you die. Another player has to manually call in a reinforcement, so make sure to do the same for them. There are a limited number of lives between the team which can be seen at the top left.

Finally, when you come back you can go pick up any gear from the last person you were, just head to where you previously died.
Don't put turrets behind you
The risk of friendly fire is everywhere in Helldivers 2, including main weapons, airstrikes, turrets, and even the dropship coming to save you. Especially when you’re extracting at the end of matches and defending the drop zone as it gets swarmed you might fall back on old instincts to ring an area with turrets.

But then you forgot those turrets care more about killing bugs and automatons than they care about you. Turrets can and will fire right through you to get to the enemy, so only put them in front of you and only in the direction where you expect the enemy to show up
You can change your ship's name
Using the same console where you upgrade it, you can change the name of your ship. Sadly this uses the same preset list from when you first jumped into the game so, though you have lots of options, you can’t ride into battle on the Justice For BoatyMcBoatface.

Stats matter
Both armor and boosters give you stat boosts. These do things like reduce recoil when prone, give you more starting grenades, provide explosive damage resistance, or lower your odds from dying when taking lethal damage. Don’t just pick the first set of armor that looks great, consider what to wear before each mission. Scout armor can even trigger a continuous ping for enemies on the map.
Take the right strategems
Stratagems are broken down into Offensive, Supply, and Defensive categories. Offensive are things like airstrikes and orbital barrages delivering immediate devastation with pretty long cooldowns. Supply stratagems are heavy or crew-served weapons you can use until they run out of ammo. Defensive stratagems are things like shield generators, turrets, and minefields best used to defend objectives like the drop zone or deny areas to the enemy.

Make sure to take a good assortment both for your own loadout, and your wider team's loadout. You want to play into strengths, offset weaknesses, and be best prepared for the mission and environment onto which you'll land.

Best Early Game Build
If you are new to the game and only have initial unlocks, the following Helldivers 2 best build early game is what you need to start with:

Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	AR-23 Liberator
Secondary Weapon	P-19 Redeemer
Grenade	G-12 High Explosive
Armor	SC-34 Infiltrator – Light
Stratagems	Eagle Airstrike, Orbital Gatling Barrage, Gatling Sentry, Grenade Launcher or Stalwart or Expendable Anti-Tank
Booster	Hellpod Space Optimization

Everything mentioned above, from the SC-34 Infiltrator Light Armor set to the stratagems and the Hellpod Space Optimization booster, can be acquired easily. You can find them on the first few pages of the free Helldivers 2 Battle Pass or purchase them from the Stratagems shop in the Ship Management menu for a reasonable cost in Warbond Medals or Requisition points.

So, why is this solution the best build for Helldivers 2, specifically for new players? The Liberator, your initial rifle, remains a reliable choice throughout the early stages of the game and stands as the second-best primary weapon, next only to the Breaker shotgun acquired later. It proves its worth effectively in the initial phases.

Likewise, the Eagle Airstrike and Orbital Gatling Barrage are top-tier stratagems accessible early on. The Eagle Airstrike excels in clearing nests or fabricators, while both are excellent for wiping out large enemy groups. The Gatling Sentry proves highly effective against anything lacking heavy armor, and you won't encounter excessively resilient foes until Tier 4 Challenging difficulty anyway.

Best Build for Robots
Robots or so-called Automatons typically field fewer units compared to bugs, but they compensate with heavier armor. Most of their units prefer ranged attacks over close-quarters combat. Additionally, their outposts are fortified with bunkers, machine gun nests along the perimeters, and larger bases boast heavily armored turret towers armed with deadly laser cannons.

The following Helldivers 2 best build for robots helps you fight this type of enemy easily:

Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	SG-225 Breaker
Secondary Weapon	P-19 Redeemer
Grenade	G-16 Impact
Armor	Light
Stratagems	Eagle Airstrike, Orbital Laser, Railgun or Autocannon, Shield Generator Pack or EMS Mortar Sentry
Booster	Vitality Enhancement
When fighting them, we suggest equipping SG-225 Breaker for swift and efficient elimination of units within their trenches and bunkers when you get in close. As for grenades, G-16 Impact proves to be an excellent option. It is ideal for clearing out fortifications and large groups of weaker bots. BLOG20

Best Build for Bugs
In comparison to Automatons, the Terminid faction's bugs are less durable but far more numerous. They relentlessly swarm, aiming to overwhelm with melee attacks, with only a handful of units capable of medium-range combat. Therefore, optimal loadouts against them prioritize swift movement for kiting and efficient crowd control to thin their horde.

Make sure to use our Helldivers 2 best build for bugs, and you will be able to handle hordes of Terminids with no problem:

Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	SMG-37 Defender
Secondary Weapon	P-19 Redeemer
Grenade	G-10 Incendiary
Armor	Light
Stratagems	Eagle Cluster Bomb or Eagle Airstrike, Orbital Laser, Orbital Gas Strike, Grenade Launcher or Railgun or Expendable Anti-Tank
Booster	Stamina Enhancement
For optimal performance against bugs, prioritize Light Armor to enhance movement and stamina regeneration, along with the Stamina Enhancement booster. In terms of weaponry, focusing on close-to-medium range combat alternatives, we would recommend that you opt for SMG-37 Defender or any other similar gun.

This weapon excels in stability when fired from the hip, a necessity for kiting swarms effectively. As for grenades, G-10 Incendiary serves as a great option. Its ability to create pools of fire is advantageous for cutting off chokepoints. On top of that, it is effective at clearing nests like other grenades, so there's no need to worry about that aspect.

Best Build for Solo Players
When you have a squad supporting you, a full-on assault can be effective. However, if you are tackling the Galactic War alone, a stealthier approach becomes imperative. In this case, our Helldivers 2 best build solo is exactly what you are looking for to excel when you have no one else to rely on:

Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	SMG-37 Defender
Secondary Weapon	P-19 Redeemer
Grenade	G-16 Impact
Armor	SC-30 Trailblazer Scout - Light
Stratagems	Eagle Airstrike, Orbital Railcannon Strike, Orbital Laser, Railgun or Autocannon
Booster	UAV Recon Booster
The Trailblazer Scout Light Armor set, obtainable from Helldivers 2's free "Helldivers Mobilize!" Warbond Battle Pass, is tailor-made for a stealthier approach. It enhances your radar capabilities while simultaneously reducing your detection by enemies. Coupled with the UAV Recon Booster, these bonuses enable you to spot and evade patrols effortlessly.

In combat situations, rely on the formidable damage output and reliability of Defender SMG, complemented by the explosive force of the G-16 Impact grenade. Reserve the Eagle Airstrike for large enemy gatherings or multiple nests/fabricators, while saving the Orbital Railcannon Strike and the Orbital Laser for heavy units, heavily fortified bases, or scenarios where you're facing overwhelming odds.

Best Helldivers 2 Loadouts Ranked
Now, let’s discuss more general build options that you can use for various in-game situations. They are not tied to being used only against specific enemies. After reading this part of the article, we will answer the question of what is the best loadout in Helldivers 2 you can use and why.

Below, we have prepared a complete list of current Helldivers 2 meta loadouts:

Support Loadout
AoE Loadout
Grenadier Loadout
Armor Penetrating Loadout
Run & Gun Loadout
Keep reading further to find more details on what gear every one of the mentioned setups is using and what makes this or that particular build so special.

Support Loadout
Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	PLAS-1 Scorcher
Secondary Weapon	P-4 Senator
Grenade	G-3 Smoke
Armor Passive	Democracy Protects
Stratagems	A/M-23 EMS Mortar Sentry, A/M-12 Mortar Sentry, MD-I4 Incendiary Mines, B-1 Supply Pack
Booster	Increased Reinforcement Budget
If you are a team player, this is arguably Helldivers 2 best build, as it focuses on bolstering the squad's overall survivability through the deployment of defensive and support stratagems. This approach prioritizes defense over offense, emphasizing the task of fortifying positions and steadfastly defending them until the last member of the squad.

Stratagems such as the A/M-23 EMS Mortar Sentry, A/M-12 Mortar Sentry, and MD-I4 Incendiary Mines excel at establishing chokepoints, effectively aiding the squad by adopting a passive offensive strategy. The Democracy Protects Armor Passive is indispensable, granting your character a 50 percent chance of surviving lethal damage. Without the support loadout player, the squad's progress is significantly limited. BLOG20

AoE Loadout
Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	JAR-5 Dominator
Secondary Weapon	P-19 Redeemer
Grenade	G-12 High Explosive
Armor Passive	Fortified
Stratagems	AC-8 Autocannon, Orbital 380MM HE Barrage, Orbital Laser, Eagle Cluster Bomb
Booster	Vitality Enhancement
For those struggling to defeat numerous enemies, the following option is often considered the best Helldivers 2 loadout on Reddit and other info resources. The main reason is that it is specifically designed to excel at clearing waves and controlling crowds. Its playstyle is centered around efficiently dealing with the swarming Terminids and Automatons that inundate the main mission areas.

The AC-8 Autocannon is highly effective due to its outstanding AoE explosive damage. It can swiftly eliminate Bile Spewers with just two shots and easily dispatch swarms of Brood Commanders and Hunters.

In situations where the AC-8 Autocannon runs out of ammo, the G-12 High Explosive grenade serves as a superb alternative for dealing AoE damage to targets. Alternatively, the JAR-5 Dominator proves effective for crowd control.

While the Eagle Cluster Bomb carries some risks, it remains unmatched as the most potent AoE stratagem available in the game.

Grenadier Loadout
Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	SG-225 Breaker
Secondary Weapon	P-19 Redeemer
Grenade	G-10 Incendiary
Armor Passive	Engineering Kit
Stratagems	GL-21 Grenade Launcher, B-1 Supply Pack, Orbital Walking Barrage, Eagle Cluster Bomb
Booster	Stamina Enhancement
The Grenadier loadout operates in a manner akin to the AoE loadout mentioned earlier and is one of the most popular HD 2 best builds currently available. Despite being similar to the alternative described above, it has several distinct differences in terms of what gear is used.

Contrary to the previous build, the primary weapon of choice shifts to the GL-21 Grenade Launcher instead of the AC-8 Autocannon. The Grenade Launcher excels at swiftly dispatching small to large-sized bugs with its explosive damage. Bile Spewers, Stalkers, and Brood Commanders can be eliminated within seconds thanks to its firepower.

This loadout and accompanying playstyle are tailored for players who prioritize sealing bug holes, demolishing egg nests, and swiftly eradicating bug swarms. Alongside the Grenade Launcher, the Eagle Cluster Bomb and Orbital Walking Barrage prove highly effective at obliterating areas with explosive force.

Armor Penetrating Loadout
Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	AR23-P Liberator Penetrator
Secondary Weapon	P-4 Senator
Grenade	G-16 Impact
Armor Passive	Servo-Assisted
Stratagems	RS-422 Railgun, Orbital Railcannon Strike, Orbital Laser, SH-32 Shield Generator Pack
Booster	Vitality Enhancement
The Armor Penetrating loadout is most effective against enemies belonging to the Automaton faction rather than the Terminids. While both factions possess armored units, the bots, in particular, present fewer vulnerabilities owing to their heavy frontal armor.

Employing the Railgun in Unsafe mode enhances its base damage significantly, making it particularly potent against Automatons. Its penetrating beam can effortlessly dispatch most Automatons with a single shot. Even formidable adversaries like Hulks and Devastators can be brought down with just two to three shots from the Railgun.

While Tanks boast the highest armor, their lone vulnerability poses no challenge for the Armor Penetrating loadout.

Run & Gun Loadout
Loadout	Gear
Primary Weapon	SG-225 Breaker
Secondary Weapon	P-2 Peacemaker
Grenade	G-16 Impact
Armor Passive	Democracy Protects
Stratagems	B-1 Supply Pack, Eagle Strafing Run, Eagle Napalm Strike, Eagle 500Kg Bomb
Booster	Stamina Enhancement
The Run & Gun loadout caters to players who prefer constant movement and engagement over static attacking or defending. This dynamic playstyle advocates for traversing the map, scavenging for samples, and raiding bunkers to collect Super Credits and Medals.

The SG-225 Breaker, as your primary weapon, proves highly effective in dispatching small to medium-sized bugs as you swiftly navigate through hot spots with your run-and-gun loadout.

In instances where you find yourself overwhelmed by swarms, the G-16 Impact grenade's instantaneous detonation will swiftly clear the wave with its rapid explosion. Alternatively, calling in the Eagle Starfing Run unleashes a Gatling gun from the sky, obliterating bugs and bots alike, shredding them to pieces with relentless firepower.

Conclusion
To sum up, mastering the art of loadout customization in Helldivers 2 is essential for maximizing effectiveness in combat scenarios. Whether tackling swarms of bugs, resilient robots, or venturing solo into the fray, adopting the right loadout can make all the difference. From specialized builds tailored to specific enemy factions to versatile setups accommodating various playstyles, there is a plethora of options to explore.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each loadout and adapting them to suit your preferred approach, you can rise to the challenge and emerge victorious in the ongoing war against extraterrestrial threats. So, assemble your gear, rally your squad, or venture forth alone – the galaxy awaits your strategic prowess.
